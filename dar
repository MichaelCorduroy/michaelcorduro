Hello Hiring Team at Tower Research Capital

I’m excited to apply for the Machine Learning Summer Intern position at Tower Research Capital. I bring strong experience in Python, C++, and machine learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow. I’ve built projects such as Conjure, a Spotlight-style AI fuzzy search launcher that learns my computer habits with a particle swarm optimization algorithm, and Severe, a 3D audio workstation for producing music spatially, demonstrating my ability to develop and deploy complex software solutions.

My background combines solid technical skills with hands-on experience building scalable systems and experimenting with ML models. I’m currently in the process of relocating to NYC and eager to contribute to your team by developing data pipelines, designing NLP models, and optimizing machine learning workflows.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to grow and contribute at Tower.
